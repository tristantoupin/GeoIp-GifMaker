# GeoIp - Gif Maker

This project is a mashup of these 2 projects: 

	- https://github.com/pierrrrrrre/PyGeoIpMap
	
	- https://github.com/tristantoupin/Ecse414-Project

Special thanks to all contributors of the project PyGeoIpMap!

Create a gif of how a packet is trasmitted from source (your laptop) to any destination. Using my other project ECSE414-Project (see for more info) you can easily study how packets circulate in a network.
